##Python mini boot camp at #NICAR15 in Atlanta


Let's use [Wakari.io](http://www.wakari.io/) bundles for this class. At the end, we'll give you everything working in Github.

As a backup plan in case the internet is bad, we'll have the bundles on the machines, and we can use the [Anaconda distro of Python](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkgs.html)'s interactive interpreter in Windows PowerShell.

###Schedule for the day
####[Introduction](http://bit.ly/intropycar14)

* Who are you, what do you do, what do you want to learn?
* What will we learn
* what can I do with it?
* The goal of the day is to start to learn how to think about solving problems.

[The Wakari bundle](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/tommeagher/pycar14)

####Project #1
Start with a CSV. Let's write some basic scripts to see what we're working with. Then we'll introduce some key Python types like strings, integers, lists, slicing and loops.
After a white board exercise, we'll start with a file of pseudocode, and we'll walk through writing the program in Python code, running the file at the command line.
We'll hold your hand through it, step by step.

####Project #2
We have a CSV of baseball player salaries. Let's figure out who makes the most money and examine some other biographical information about them, using dictionaries.

At the end of the day, we'll __[send you home with](takehome/README.md)__ with:

* A [lightning dash](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/tommeagher/PyCAR_basics) through basic variables, types and functions.
* the working, commented code for each project from our git repo
* a walkthrough for setting up your machine at home with Python, version control and virtualenvs.
* Good libraries to explore with strong tutorials
* lifetime support guarantee [from us](CONTRIBUTORS.md) & [PythonJournos](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/PythonJournos)
